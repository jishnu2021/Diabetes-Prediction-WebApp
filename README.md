## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for managing and preventing the adverse effects of diabetes. This project provides a simple, user-friendly web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health metrics.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using user input
- Uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification
- Standardizes input data using StandardScaler for better model performance
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
