# Diabetes-Prediction-WebApp
This repository contains a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a web application built with Streamlit. The model uses various health metrics as input and predicts whether a person has diabetes. The input data is standardized using a StandardScaler for improved performance.
